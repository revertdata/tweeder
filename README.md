# Tweeder

> A script to clean my twitter account to cater to my own ticks.

I previously kept a 1:1 following ratio, but decided to start only following people who I regularly interact with, instead.  This script also deletes certain tweets and keeps my account tidy.

It's called Tweeder because my last name is Weed.
